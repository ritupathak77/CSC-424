All two-toed sloths have a double-layered coat, consisting of a dense, soft undercoat and long coarse overcoat to provide insulation and help with rainwater runoff.', 'Two-toed sloths are herbivores meaning they like to eat almost anything that is leafy and green. They will also eat some bird eggs or small insects occasionally.','Two-toed sloths live mainly solitary lives.

A baby sloth clings to its mother constantly and rarely moves besides feeding for months.', 'They can spend their entire lives in treetops, but will come down to the ground on occasion. When on the ground they are normally very clumsy, but if they make it to water, they swim well due to their long limbs.');

The emerald green becomes black several months after shedding. As a young tegu, the tail is banded yellow and black; as it ages, the solid yellow bands nearest to the body change to areas of weak speckling. Fewer solid bands indicates an older animal. An adult can be as large as 4 and a half feet long and weigh just under 16 pounds. A tegu can drop a section of its tail as a distraction if attacked. The tail is also used as a weapon to swipe at an aggressor; even a half-hearted swipe can leave a bruise.', 'Juvenile tegus in the wild have been observed to eat a wide range of invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and snails. They also eat fruits and seeds. As they grow they become more predatory and the protein content of their diet rises. They may seek out eggs from other reptiles and from birds'' nests, and will eat small birds and other vertebrates.

Few grow over about 4 ft (1.2 m) long, and most stay smaller. Most have longitudinal stripes in many different colors. Common garter snakes come in a wide range of colors, including green, blue, yellow, gold, red, orange, brown, and black. ', 'The diet of the common garter snake consists mainly of amphibians and earthworms, but also fish, small birds, and rodents. Common garter snakes are effective at catching fast-moving creatures such as fish and tadpoles. ', 'In the early part of sex, when snakes are coming out of hibernation, the males generally emerge first to be ready when the females wake up. Some males assume the role of a female and lead other males away from the burrow, luring them with a fake female pheromone. After such a male has led rivals away, he "turns" back into a male and races back to the den, just as the females emerge. He is then the first to mate with all the females he can catch.  Generally, populations include far more males than females, so during mating season, they form "mating balls", where one or two females are completely swamped by 10 or more males. Sometimes, a male snake mates with a female before hibernation, and the female stores the sperm internally until spring, when she allows her eggs to be fertilized. If she mates again in the spring, the fall sperm degenerate, and the spring sperm fertilize her eggs. The females may give birth ovoviviparously to 12 to 40 young from July through October. ', 'The saliva of a common garter snake may be toxic to amphibians and other small animals. Garter snakes have a mild venom in their saliva.[10] For humans, a bite is not dangerous, though it may cause slight itching, burning, and/or swelling. Most common garter snakes also secrete a foul-smelling fluid from postanal glands when handled or harmed. Common garter snakes are resistant to naturally found poisons such as that of the American toad and rough-skinned newt, the latter of which can kill a human if ingested. They have the ability to absorb the toxin from the newts into their bodies, making them poisonous, which can deter potential predators. The common garter snake uses toxicity for both offense and defense. On the offensive side, the snake''s venom can be toxic to some of its smaller prey, such as mice and other rodents. On the defensive side, the snake uses its resistance to toxicity to provide an important antipredator capability. A study on the evolutionary development of resistance of tetrodotoxin tested between two populations of Thamnophis and then tested inside a population of T. sirtalis. Those that were exposed to and lived in the same environment as the newts that produce tetrodotoxin when eaten were more immune to the toxin.');

A fully mature Rose Hair can reach approximately 6 inches in its total leg span. They reach full size in about 3 – 4 years. They are usually either dark brown, blackish or grey in their base color. Some Chilean rose hair tarantulas have orange/reddish hairs all over their body, while others have a tan body with pink hairs and some have copper colored hairs. They have eight eyes; they are very small and generally not very strong.', 'These spiders eat large insects like beetles, roaches, grasshoppers, and crickets; sometimes other tarantulas, spiders, baby mice, and frogs.', 'Once a male has reached sexual maturity, he will create a sperm web before he is introduced to the female''s terrarium. He eventually approaches the female''s burrow with caution, tapping and vibrating his legs to attract her out of her shelter. At the opportune moment, the male lunges himself forward and using his hooks, holds the female''s chelicerae, pushing his mate into a vertical position, giving him access to the female''s epigyne. The male inserts one, or both, pedipalp into the female''s epigyne and injects the fertilizing fluid. In the weeks following fertilization, the female produces a large egg sack.', 'The rose haired tarantula is relatively docile, low-maintenance, and inexpensive, so they are popular as pets, kept in terrariums. Though docile, they can become aggressive if handled too frequently. It is also usually very skittish, running away from danger rather than acting defensively, but it may also raise its front legs and present its fangs in preparation to defend itself. It can act especially defensive for days after moulting; this may be innate in the spider''s behavior. As with the majority of tarantulas from the Americas, it has small, spine-like urticating hairs on its abdomen that it kicks off or releases when threatened as a defense.');

Males have larger pronotal humps on their thorax and bushier antennae than females.', 'They are scavengers that eat a variety of fruit and leafy greens that they can find on the forest floor. ', 'Mating occurs in an end-to-end position. To achieve this, the male pushes his abdomen under and along the female''s body until he engages the end of her abdomen. Although hissing plays an important role in colony hierachy and courtship interactions, it is the disturbance hisses that most people are familiar with.', 'As the common name suggests, the Madagascar hissing cockroach is characterized by their hissing sound, which is produced when they forcefully expel air through the specially-adapted respiratory openings (spiracles) on the fourth segment of their body, though spiracles are found on all segments of their abdomen. A few less commonly known facts are they are excellent climbers and can scale smooth glass, and they have been known to live up to 5 years in captivity.');

Their limbs are underdeveloped and possess long, thin digits. Males are identified by their swollen cloacae lined with papillae, while females are noticeable for their wider bodies full of eggs. Three pairs of external gill stalks (rami) originate behind their heads and are used to move oxygenated water. The external gill rami are lined with filaments (fimbriae) to increase surface area for gas exchange. Four gill slits lined with gill rakers are hidden underneath the external gills.Axolotls have barely visible vestigial teeth, which would have developed during metamorphosis.', 'The axolotl is carnivorous, consuming small prey such as worms, insects, and small fish in the wild. Axolotls locate food by smell, and will "snap" at any potential meal, sucking the food into their stomachs with vacuum force.', 'The male axolotl displays interest in the female axolotl by nudging her hindquarters with his nose. If she is receptive, the male axolotl will then attempt to court her by placing himself in front of her and then leading her, nose to tail, around the aquarium. As he walks forward, he deposits a packet of sperm known as a spermatophore, and he will then lead the female axolotl forward until her cloaca is directly above it. She then takes the spermatophore up into her cloaca. The male axolotl resumes leading the female forward, and she will pick up several packets of sperm over the course of an hour or so. Egg-laying takes place between 12 and 72 hours later. Up to 1,500 axolotl eggs may be deposited individually on nearby plants. In ideal conditions the eggs will hatch in just over 2 weeks.', 'Axolotls seem to be very similar to salamanders in the way they grow and develop. They exibit neoteny like salamanders, meaning they reach sexual maturity without undergoing a metamorphasis. They are also known for their amazing regeneration. The axolotl does not heal by scarring and is capable of the regeneration of entire lost appendages in a period of months, and, in certain cases, more vital structures, such as tail, limb, central nervous system, and tissues of the eye and heart. Some have indeed been found restoring the less vital parts of their brains. They can also readily accept transplants from other individuals, including eyes and parts of the brain—restoring these alien organs to full functionality. In some cases, axolotls have been known to repair a damaged limb, as well as regenerating an additional one, ending up with an extra appendage that makes them attractive to pet owners as a novelty. In metamorphosed individuals, however, the ability to regenerate is greatly diminished. The axolotl is therefore used as a model for the development of limbs in vertebrates.');

The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.', 'They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates, they also eat plants, dog food, and household refuse. Basically if they can fit it in their mouth then it''s down the hatch.', 'During the breeding season, male cane toads settle near lakes, rivers and even backyard ponds and start to call in the hope of attracting a female. Cane toads lay their eggs in still or slow flowing water. Females can produce between 8,000 – 35,000 eggs at a time and usually breed twice a year.', 'The cane toad has poison glands, and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Its toxic skin can kill many animals, both wild and domesticated, and cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs. Because of its voracious appetite, the cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands as a method of agricultural pest control. The common name of the species is derived from its use against the cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum), which damages sugar cane. The cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions.');

It has a vibrant green body with yellow and blue with vertically striped sides. Its webbed feet and toes are orange or red. The skin on the red-eyed treefrog''s belly is soft and fragile, whereas the back is thicker and rougher. Red-eyed tree frogs have sticky pads on their toes to cling onto leaves.', 'Red-eyed treefrogs are mainly insectivores, eating crickets, moths, grasshoppers, flies, and other insects. Sometimes, they eat smaller frogs. Tadpoles mostly eat fruit flies and pinhead crickets.', 'The larger the male frog appears signifies older age which can reflect a better partner. During the mating season, the male frogs shake the branches where they are sitting to improve their chances of finding a mate by keeping rivals at bay. When rainfall is at its highest, a male red-eyed treefrog calls "chack" to get the attention of the female. Females use the call as well as color of the male frog in order to find a possible mate. During amplexus, the female carries the male on her back for several hours during the oviposition process. The female chooses a leaf above a pond or large puddle on which to lay her clutch of roughly 40 eggs. Since oviposition generally occurs on both sides of a leaf, red-eyed treefrogs may fold the leaf to hide the eggs from predators. They also produce sticky jelly to glue the eggs together; this may protect the eggs from splitting and dehydration. The eggs generally hatch within a week.', 'Red-eyed treefrogs'' embryos exhibit phenotypic plasticity, hatching early in response to disturbance to protect themselves. Though embryos are bred synchronously, they normally hatch after 6 to 10 days from oviposition without disturbance. However, a simultaneously early hatching in entire clutches is triggered when embryos are exposed to their predators or threatening environmental changes such as rainstorm and flood. They spend a majority of their lives in trees, and they are excellent jumpers. Red-eyed treefrogs are not poisonous and rely on camouflage to protect themselves. During the day, they remain motionless, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their bellies, and shut their red eyes. Thus, they appear almost completely green, and well hidden among the foliage.');
